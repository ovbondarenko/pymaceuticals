# Observed Trends

Analysed results of treatments with three different drugs (Capomulin,  Infubinol and Ketaprin) and compared their performance with placebo.
Metrics: Overall tumor volume change, number of new metastatic sites and survival rate

- First, let us consder the effect of the placebo, since we are going to compare performances of the three drugs to it. 45-day long placebo treatment resulted in ~50% tumor volume increase, 3 additional metastatic sites and suvival rate under 50%
- Capomulin is the only effective drug, leading to the overall tumor shrinkage of ~19% by the end of the treatment, formation of 1.5 new metastatic sites and survival rate of ~ 84%
- Two other drugs, Infubinol and Ketapin, perform similarly to the placibo in terms of tumor volume change (the error bars overlap).
- Metastatic site formation: Capomulin - significantly better then placibo, Ketapril - same as placibo, Infubinol - fewer new sites than placibo, but more then Capomulin
- Survival rate - Capomulin much better then placibo, Infubinol and Ketaprin - similar to placebo.

In summary, Capomulin is the only one of the three drugs considered in the analysis, which has been demnstrated to be effective in tumor tratment, leading to almost 20% tumor volume reduction over the treatment duration of 45 days. Capomulin also strongly outperforms placebo Infubinol and Ketaprin treatments in terms survival rate. Capomulin treatment shows suppressed formation of new metastatic sites compared to the other two treatments and placebo.
